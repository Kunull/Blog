I have decided to start a blog to write about things that interest me. 
The posts will be about security and technology for now, but might cover other topics in the future.

<!-- truncate -->

This is going to compliment my [research](https://research.kunull.net) and my [CTF writeups](https://writeups.kunull.net/).
Topics covered will mostly include:

- Short guides
- Certification reviews
- Conference experience (If I get the time to visit any)
- Some technology that I am interested in

Blogs post of similar topics can be found under the same tag.
